# project iso

## details  
a stylized, expressive 3d basketball simulation game. inspired by the mechanics of nba jam and the energy of jet set radio / bomb rush cyberfunk, with gameplay depth and motion goals similar to the nba 2k series.

being built in godot. blender for animations and assets. xbox controller support planned from the start.

## why?  
this project is a way for me to explore game design, animation workflows, and physics-based character control. it's also a creative outlet for blending rhythm, movement, and basketball into something unique.

this repo is meant to document the learning journey and process â€” those early commits will be very messy.
