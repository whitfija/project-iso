# project iso

a stylized, expressive 3d basketball simulation game. inspired by the mechanics of nba jam and the energy of jet set radio / bomb rush cyberfunk, with gameplay depth and motion goals similar to the nba 2k series.

being built in godot. blender for animations and assets

this project is a way for me to explore game design, animation workflows and physics-based character control. this repo is meant to document the learning journey and process (those early commits will be very messy)
